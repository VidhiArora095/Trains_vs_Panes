    "# Trains vs. Planes - Who is taking us to a better environmental destination?\n",

    "by Vidhi Arora\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to explore the environmental impact of international travel within Europe and compares two modes of travel: Trains and Planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environmental cost of travel by one mode or the other has been calculated by correlating the carbon emissions against the number of train stations and airports in a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The European Commission recently announced that it aims to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It unveiled what it is billing as the biggest \"green\" stimulus package in history (European Commission, 2020). The purpose of this analysis is therefore to answer the question of whether european countries should be investing more in its train infrastructure rather than its aviation infrastructure.\n",

    "The [airport data](https://ourairports.com/help/data-dictionary.htmltaken) taken from the \"ourairports\" website:  - Accessed: 23rd May 2020- is an open source website containg data about airports around the world. The data is upto date. Each line in the datset represents an airport.\n",
